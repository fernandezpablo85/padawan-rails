== Welcome to Padawan on Rails

Padawan on Rails is a demo application, it includes a simple domain that represents
a learning institute.

The domain includes:

 * Teachers:     They give lectures in courses (really in shifts of this courses)
 * Students:     They attend to courses
 * Courses:      Have limited vacants
 * Shifts:       A course can have many shifts (Afternoon, Night or Morning)
 * Inscription:  The relation between a student and a shift

The project was made for learning purposes only, its fully tested with RSPEC and it implements
some caching techniques (page caching) to improve performance.
